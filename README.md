# Flatpack - A superflat mod that piggybacks vanilla generation
At the moment the overworld is the only flat dimension. This is very early in development so there may be crashes/bugs.

### Working Generation üòç
I think all above ground features are placed correctly/show up on the surface in some way. Unwanted behaviour is listed below

### Bedrock Caves
These spawn below the base bedrock level (y = -64 is still the bottom of the world) - a happy accident as a result of raising the initial bedrock. These caves are essentially spawn proof. I plan to add configuration/settings i.e. to toggle these on/off.
